I\+L\+I9163\+C-\/ A fast S\+P\+I driver for T\+F\+T that use Ilitek I\+L\+I9163\+C.

Features\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}- Very FAST!, expecially with Teensy 3.x where uses DMA SPI.
- It uses just 4 or 5 wires.
- Compatible at command level with Adafruit display series so it's easy to adapt existing code.
- It uses the standard Adafruit_GFX Library (you need to install). 
\end{DoxyVerb}


Pay Attention to connections!!!!\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}- This display has logic at 3V3 volt so YOU NEED A VOLTAGE CONVERTER if you plan to use with arduino.
If you try to connect directly you can burn it very fast so PAY ATTENTION!
- My display works at 3V3 volt for logic but LED background has resistor for 5V. Your can be different
so carefully check out before connect it.
- My library works only in SPI mode by using MOSI,SCLK and a CS pin plus an additional pin for DC (or RS).
I've used also the reset pin but you can save it by connect it at 3V3 volt and use the constructor without
the reset pin. The initialization routine will automatically use the software reset.
- People using Teensy3 should remember that have to choose for CS and DC a pin that satisfy:

if (pin == 2 || pin == 6 || pin == 9) return true;
if (pin == 10 || pin == 15) return true;
if (pin >= 20 && pin <= 23) return true;
\end{DoxyVerb}


Background\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}I got one of those displays from a chinese ebay seller but unfortunatly I cannot get
any working library so I decided to hack it. ILI9163C looks pretty similar to other 
display driver but it uses it's own commands so it's tricky to work with it unlsess you
carefully fight with his gigantic and not so clever datasheet.
My display it's a 1.44"", 128x128 that suppose to substitute Nokia 5110 LCD and here's the 
first confusion! Many sellers claim that it's compatible with Nokia 5110 (that use a philips
controller) but the only similarity it's the pin names since that this one it's color and
have totally different controller that's not compatible. Altrough I discovered that it's not
128x128 but 128x160 (!??)... Check links below to see if it's similar to yours.

160*128 or whatever, also there's a strain of this display with a black PCB that a friend of mine
got some weeks ago and need some small changes in library to get working.
If you look at TFT_ILI9163C.h file you can add your modifications and let me know so I
can include for future versions.
\end{DoxyVerb}


Code Optimizations\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}The purpose of this library it's SPEED. I have tried to use hardware optimized calls
where was possible and results are quite good for most applications.
Of course it can be improved so feel free to add suggestions.
